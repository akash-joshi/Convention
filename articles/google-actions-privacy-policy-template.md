# Google Actions Privacy Policy Template

The default one doesn't give much info, and no good template exists online, so I decided to make one myself ! It does work, I tested it on a skill myself !

Simply copy the following template, filling in your info where required. Google does accept a Docs link as a valid privacy policy !

I'm a solo developer, so do consider buying me a coffee to show your appreciation !
