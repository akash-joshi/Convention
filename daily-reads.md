# Daily Reads - My Podcast

I keep tabs on several different websites and news aggregators. This gives me access to some of the best and most interesting articles in tech and the world. So, I started this podcast to share this knowledge with everyone else ðŸ˜„ !

The episodes are really small, from 4 to 5 minutes. Have a listen to an episode below ðŸ”¥ !
